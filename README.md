# Dual-Port-RAM-Design-and-Verification
 Dual-port RAM can be written and read simultaneously. This special type of RAM has two unidirectional data ports - an input port for writing data and an output port for reading data. Each port has its own data and address buses. The write port has a signal called WRITE to allow writing the data. The read port has a signal called READ to enable the data output. Both reading and writing data occur on the rising clock edge.And verifiy read and write signals.
